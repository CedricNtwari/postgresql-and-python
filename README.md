## Chinook Database

The Chinook database is a sample database available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc., that represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. This repository contains SQL scripts to help you install, populate, and manipulate the Chinook database for learning and testing SQL queries.

## What is Chinook Database?

The Chinook database is a set of SQL commands contained in a text file, designed to simulate a real-world scenario for a digital media store. This database is an excellent resource for practicing SQL and understanding database management and querying techniques.

## What does it do?

Chinook Database allows us to script database operations, such as creating, populating, and updating databases.

## How do you use it?

Chinook Database puts database commands in a .sql file, and run them using the Postgres command line interface.

## Features

Schema Setup: Scripts to create and setup the database schema.
Data Population: Scripts to populate the database with sample data.
Query Examples: A variety of SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
Updates and Migrations: Scripts for updating data and schema migrations.

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
